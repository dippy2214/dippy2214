## 🙋‍♂️ Introducing myself

Hi there, I'm Josh and I am a student at abertay university. I study Computer Games Applications Development and my main languages are C++ and C#. 
My passions lie in tools programming and getting to make interesting projects that teach me something new. I rarely make the same thing twice as I'm
always looking to go another level deeper and explore new interesting areas of the programming world. 

I also have skills in bluetooth programming, having taught myself to code it from the ground up as part of my wiimote project, and am very willing to
try to pick up anything new and interesting.
